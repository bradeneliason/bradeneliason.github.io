This is a catch-all post for various 3D printing projects that I've done around the house. None of these prints really warrants a post by themselves, but they were rewarding projects worthy of sharing in some form nonetheless.

## TV Lift

I placed a soundbar in front of my TV. The speaker ended up being just high enough to block the IR receiver on the TV. The black printed feet lift up the TV enough to allow the soundbar to fit just beneath. Our Monstera deliciosa, Cookie, is making a guest appearance on the right.

## Drawer Organizers

3D Printing is very enjoyable; organizing drawers is not. Solution: 3D print your own modular drawer organizers. The design was done by me, but it was inspired by the organization bins designed by Alexandre Chappel. The have a base dimension of 50 mm. The image on the right is a 2×2×1 bin. The tab at the front has a recess which is wide enough for a $\frac{1}{4}"$ wide label. Print files available here.

## Wire Organizer

Speaking of organizers, a while ago I made a quick 3D printed organizer for my breadboard jumper wires. The wires came in a kit as a large bundle. Entropy took its course, and soon I had a multi-colored spaghetti pile of jumper wires. I'm realizing now fighting household entropy may be one of the killer apps for 3D printing—provided you have the design tools to make organizational devices to your heart's content.

## Beard Trimmer Attachments

Yet another organizer... this time for beard trimmer attachments. Extracting the shape of each attachment was a small exercise in reverse engineering. I laid each attachment on its side on my flat bed scanner with a ruler. Using an image analysis software called Fiji, I was able to get the precise shape of each attachment. This model is designed to print upside-down with most of the body shelled out.

## Tall Desk Organizer

Okay, last organizational device, I promise. This was designed and printed at the request of my partner. She was browsing desk organizers online and found one she liked. It ends up being cheaper to print such devices yourself; this device cost about \$2.50 in filament and electricity. The added benefit is you can customize the dimensions. In this case, my partner wanted this organizer to be able to fit Post-it notes.

## An Ornamental Forest

For the holidays, I went into factory mode and printed over a dozen little Christmas ornaments as gifts. The model is available here (not designed by me). I spent a bit of time optimizing the print settings and got the print time down to 22 minutes (from about 45 min). I'm sure the print time could be reduced further but probably not without compromising the quality or strength.
Power Disks

## Power Disk Ornaments

Last Christmas, I printed three custom power discs for my three little niblings (names blurred out). Power disks are from the children's show Wild Kratts and give the main characters the form and powers of various creatures. The little rascals soon were trading disks and imbuing themselves with the powers of their siblings.
